tmux (3.1~rc1-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  Please restart tmux entirely after upgrading to 3.1: an old server and
  a new client will not be fully compatible with each other and the new
  client may hang.

  Note: if necessary the old client can be used via /proc/pid/exe to
  talk to the old server, e.g. `/proc/$(pgrep "tmux: server")/exe attach'.

tmux (1.4-7) unstable; urgency=low

  Starting with version 1.4-7, tmux is no longer installed setgid utmp and
  server sockets are no longer placed under /var/run/tmux, reverting to
  the default upstream behavior (sockets in a user directory under /tmp).

  We recommend that you close any open tmux sessions before proceeding
  with the upgrade. If necessary, old servers can be accessed after the
  upgrade with e.g. "tmux -S /var/run/tmux/tmux-`id -u`/default attach".

tmux (1.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  Due to an update in the server protocol from version 5 to version 6
  users need to terminate open tmux sessions before proceeding with
  updating tmux 1.2 or older.
